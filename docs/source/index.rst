LangChain Widget
================

`langchain-widget` is an `anywidget` + React chat UI for LangChain tool-calling chat models, built for notebooks and designed to compose with other Jupyter widgets.

- Bring tool-calling agents into JupyterLab / Notebook
- Wire up your own tools (data access, simulations, widget actions, etc.)
- Keep the UI close to your analysis: plots, tables, and domain widgets
